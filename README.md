# E-Chef Application üßÅ

E-Chef is a desktop application designed to simplify cooking by helping users manage recipes and ingredients. It is built as a **Windows Forms Application** in **C#** using Visual Studio and integrates an **Arduino-based scale** for precise ingredient measurements. The application is backed by a **Microsoft SQL Server** database to store and manage recipes and user information.

This project was developed as part of my **12th-grade final project** and primarily serves as a demonstration of integrating software and hardware in a practical way. Since the focus was on showcasing basic functionality, most of the interface and content are in **Hungarian**, reflecting its initial audience. While it's not a highly advanced application, it provides a solid example of my early programming experience.
